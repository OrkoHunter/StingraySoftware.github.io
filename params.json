Such a widely used and standard software package does not exist for X-ray *timing*, that remains for now mostly done with custom software. During the workshop [The Spectral Timing Revolution](http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2016/720/info.php3?wsid=720&venue=Oort), a group of X-ray astronomers and developers have decided to agree on a common platform to develop a new software package. This software package will merge existing efforts for a timing package in Python, and be structured with the best guidelines for modern open-source programming, following the example of [Astropy](www.astropy.org). This software will have an easily accessible scripting interface (possibly a GUI) and a public API for power users. The ultimate goal is to provide the community with a package that eases the learning curve for the advanced spectral timing techniques with a correct statistical framework.\r\n\r\n#### Previous projects that are being merged in Stingray\r\n\r\n+ Daniela Huppenkothen's original Stingray\r\n\r\n+ Matteo Bachetti's [MaLTPyNT](https://github.com/matteobachetti/MaLTPyNT)\r\n\r\n+ Simone Migliari's and Paul Balm's (...)
